# SQL Portfolio - Ilona Shkil

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! My name is Ilona Shkil, and I am a starting business analyst with a passion for **data analysis** and problem-solving.

## Overview

This portfolio showcases my experience working with SQL and related tools to solve business problems and analyze data. Each project in this portfolio highlights a different aspect of my SQL skills, including **data manipulation**, **query optimization**, and **database design**.

## Projects

- **Khan Academy Exercises:** These exercises are basic, but completing them helped me remove some rust and sharpen my SQL skills. I enjoyed working on these exercises and found them to be a helpful refresher.
- **Murder Mystery Riddle:** Although I completed this riddle a while ago, I decided to include it in my portfolio because it was a fun and challenging exercise that allowed me to practice my SQL skills in a unique and creative way.
- **Netflix Data Analysis:** This project involves exploring the data of Netflix movies and TV shows from various aspects. I used SQL to manipulate and analyze the data, and you can find the SQL file with the queries and results in the [link](https://github.com/ilonashkil/sql_portfolio/blob/main/Neftflix_Data_Analysis/Netflix_Titles_Project.sql).
- **Spotify Streams Data Analysis:** This project involves analyzing data about the streams of songs on Spotify, including the number of streams, release date, and various features of the songs. The focus is more on the songs themselves rather than user behavior. I am currently working on this project and will continue to update my portfolio as I make progress in the [link](https://github.com/ilonashkil/sql_portfolio/blob/main/Spotify_Data_Analysis/Spotify_Streams_Project.sql).

## Skills and Tools

In addition to the above projects, I am proficient in using SQL for **data analysis**, and I have experience working with various relational database management systems (DBMS), including **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**. Additionally, I have experience using **SQL Workbench** and **Tableau** to visualize and present data insights.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback.
